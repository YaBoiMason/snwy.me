      <h1>tiny</h1>
<p>i decided to figure out what the smallest usable language i could build is. it's pretty usable and only 84 lines of python code. (i know i could have built a brainfuck interpreter in like -2 lines of code but i wanted something usable)</p>
<h2>sample code</h2>
<pre>; accept number as input<br>input n<br>p = 1<br><br>p = * p n<br>n = - n 1<br>; if n is greater than zero, go back to line 5<br>condition = > n 0<br>goto 5 condition<br><br>; print the result<br>print p</pre>
